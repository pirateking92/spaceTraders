# SpaceTraders

A simple web application using the spacetraders.io api into a basic, interactable UI.
A new user can be registered, the information of the user (the agent) can be seen, and then the starting location can be viewed along with some extra information about the contract given at the start of the game.
The application was completely test driven with vitest.

## Design Choices and Future Thoughts

Learning from some previous mistakes on personal projects, I took time at the beginning to properly look through the examples on the SpaceTraders website, play the game, read through the starter code, and plan out tests.

I made the choice to test drive the application, as previous experience from Makers and from a successful project showed that proper planning was done for features, edge cases are thought of, and generally creates a satisfying process.

As per the instructions, I worked through as much of the quickstart as time allowed, with a focus on creating a robust vertical slice application, that is tested, intuitive to navigate through, and easy on api calls. This resulted in reaching the end of the new game quickstart only, but has also meant that the features added have been tested and I'm confident that it is more robust than without.

I used TailwindCSS for styling as I have found this easy to learn, read and implement across a number of projects. If I had more time, I would have liked to do more styling, though having the application work feels to be the most important, rather than its aesthetics at the beginning.

I would have also liked to add some testing with an automation tool such as Cypress, as I have played around with these before and would have liked to improve my skills with an automation tool, simulate a user interaction, and also because it was quite fun and satisfying to see the program go through a set of actions.

Thanks for taking the time to
